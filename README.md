Netherlands Energy Future: Forecasting and Scenario Modeling Project
# Netherlands Energy Future: Forecasting and Scenario Modeling Project

This project utilizes energy data from the Netherlands to forecast future energy consumption/production and to model various economic and policy-based scenarios. The goal is to build a foundation for a decision support system based on a data-driven approach to potential energy futures.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The project first develops a forecasting model using time series analysis and machine learning techniques on historical energy data. This baseline forecast is then used as a foundation to apply different scenarios based on "what-if" assumptions (e.g., an increase in renewable energy incentives, changes in economic growth rates, etc.). The results are then visualized for clear interpretation.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Time Series Forecasting:** Includes a model to predict the future energy demand/supply in the Netherlands.
- **Scenario Modeling:** Allows for "what-if" analysis based on different assumptions to model various future outcomes.
- **Data Visualization:** Effectively visualizes forecast and scenario results using `Seaborn` and `Matplotlib`.
- **Reproducibility:** Designed to be easily run on different systems using a virtual environment and a `requirements.txt` file.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [PASTE_YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL_HERE]
    cd ai_mis_dss
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**
    It is best practice to create a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies.
    ```bash
    # Create a virtual environment (e.g., named 'my_env')
    python -m venv my_env
    ```
    *   **Activate on Windows (PowerShell):**
        ```powershell
        .\my_env\Scripts\Activate
        ```
    *   **Activate on macOS / Linux:**
        ```bash
        source my_env/bin/activate
        ```
    You should see `(my_env)` at the beginning of your terminal prompt.

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    The `requirements.txt` file lists all the necessary libraries for this project.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    > **Note:** If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, you can easily create one while your virtual environment is active by running: `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.

## 📈 How to Run

1.  **Generate the Forecast (If it's a separate step):**
    First, run the forecasting model to generate the `netherlands_energy_forecast.csv` file.
    ```bash
    python forecast.py
    ```

2.  **Run the Scenario Modeling:**
    Execute the main script to model scenarios based on the generated forecast data.
    ```bash
    python scenario_modeling.py
    ```
    This script will produce the analysis results, which could be plots, charts, or updated CSV files.

## 💻 Tech Stack

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib:** For data visualization.
- **[Scikit-learn / Statsmodels / Prophet]:** The library used for time series forecasting. [Choose or add the correct one].
